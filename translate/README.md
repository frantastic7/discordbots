# Translation bot


Translation bot, uses the free mymemory api. (Character limit is 1000 per translation)  

Call it with /translate languageFrom languageTo TextToTranslate.

e.g. "/translate english spanish hello" --> "hola"  

languages are not case sensitive but require full names, not abreviation like EN ES IT.  

Check the lang.json folder to find out all the languages available.

Will be releasing a new LLM powered version soon, with the ability to understand context and to detect the language without user specifying if the users try to translate something they are unfamiliar with.
